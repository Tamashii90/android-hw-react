A ReactJS app that allows **drivers** to keep track of their traffic violations. Also has an admin dashboard for users with **admin** authorities. See backend [here](https://github.com/Tamashii90/android-hw-backend).

## Features
- Log in using name and vehicle's plate number for **drivers**, and nickname & password for **admins**.
- Search for all committed violations (**admin**) or unpaid committed violations (**driver**).
- **Admins** can register new vehicles.
- **Admins** can submit a committed violation under a vehicle.
- **Admins** can edit violations
- **Admins** can cross vehicles out and doing so will exclude the vehicle's violations from search results.
- **Drivers** can pay their committed violations.
